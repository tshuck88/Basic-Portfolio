        <p>Hi there! Welcome to my personal website. Here you will find some information about me and a link to my
            portfolio. I created this website to showcase some of my web development skills and as place to keep my
            portfolio updated.
        </p>
        <p>I have lived in the Puget Sound region my entire life being born in Federal Way and raised in
            Woodinvile. I currently live in Queen Anne with my girlfriend Tessa and dog Stewart. I graduated from
            Western Washington University with a BA in Business Administration concentration in Finance and a
            minor in Economics. I am currently enrolled in UW's Coding Bootcmap to expand my skills and learn web
            development and to break into the technology field. Click on the portfolion tab at the top to view some of
            the projects I have worked on in this class.
        </p>
        <p>
            I enjoy taking my dog for walks along the Ship Canal Trail on beautiful Seattle summer days, trying new
            beers from the many different breweries throughout the city, and listening to music and attending live
            shows.
            I am an avid sports fan and love attending pretty much any sporting event, but I mostly follow the NFL and
            NBA. I am also a fantasy football enthusiast and have been playing since I was in middle school.
        </p>
        <p>
            I hope I was able to give you a glimpse of who I am and what I am about. Feel free to leave your contact
            information if you would like to reach out or have any questions. Cheers!
